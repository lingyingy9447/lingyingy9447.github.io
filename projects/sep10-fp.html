            <h2>Context/Content</h2>
            <p>The “Freedom Project” for SEP 10 is all about educating people around the world about technology that already exists and what technology will be like in the future. Students will be choosing a topic that they are passionate about and spend the rest of the year working toward their MVP (minimum viable product). The process of this project includes gathering information, brainstorming future ideas, learning the selected tool, and creating the final product. </p>
            <p>For my project, I am making a website about Music using HTML, CSS, Github, Bootstrap, and Tailwindcss. This website start off by giving you a brief introduction to Music and then it will walk you through the technologies that already existed in the field of music and the possible future ideas. It will show you how powerful technologies has on the impact of music.</p>
            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>One of the biggest challenges I faced during this process is learning Tailwind. It was a challenge because I had to self learn it. At first I was very puzzled and didn't know how to learn tailwind by myself. However, my classmates gave me advices to follow tutorials videos and tinker with them. Through this process I watched a lot of tutorial videos on Youtube and I spent hours and hours reading through the document and tinkering with the tool. Another challenge I faced was researching the hardwares and softwares that already existed. It took me a couple weeks to finalize my research because I had to choose the hardwares and softwares that function differently and incorporate them into my website. Through this process of researching I eliminated many hardwares and softwares that are duplicates of each other however I learned a lot about how techonolgy has a impact on music. It was a tough process because I had to decide on what hardwares and software fit the best in my website.  Moreover, I faced a challenge when I added an extra <code>closing div</code> which ended the accordion. This messed up the timeline and made the image and the number go the opposite direction. The solution to this problem is using an inspector tool. After this I realized that indentation is vital to maintain the accuracy of code. </p>

            <p>One of my takeaways from this year-long project is that you have to read the documentation from the top to the bottom because you might miss out a lot of information if you only read a certain part. Another takeaway is that you have to be very careful on what you code because one simple mistake might ruin the entire website. Lastly, you have to be confident and tinker with different codes and think to yourself if X changes to Y what will happen.</p>
            <p>My next step for this project is to make the website more responsive by centering the cards and making the timeline go on top of each other on a small screen.</p>
